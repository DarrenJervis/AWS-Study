##### AWS Free Training Vids – Cloud Practioner level
>“This is the link to the free training videos I mentioned from AWS themselves – these give a really good grounding in the core subject areas (And can form basis of training for taking the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam – if you should want to). You will just need to setup an AWS training account & then subscribe to the free training course.

##### AWS AWSome Days – AWS Tech Essentials Level (pre associate)
>AWS often run free one-day “AWSome Days” – which have lots of foundational technical sessions on the day. It’s worth subscribing to an AWSome day when one comes up even if you can’t attend the sessions on the day, as they then provide access to all the videos afterwards if you subscribed - So you can watch them\make notes at your own pace (though when I did it - they only remained available for a period of time – not forever). 

##### Linux Academy Training
>Linux Academy do a free 7 day trial period (& sometimes do very good subscription deals in the post-Christmas sales period):
